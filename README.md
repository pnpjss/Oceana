## Assignment

- Create an invitational landing page for a real or fake event of your own choice.

# Design by Teresa Eriksson

## Code review

### Erik White

- Clever use of the contact list csv and 'invites.json', didn't think of this.
- Don't forget to add 'dist' folder to .gitignore
- 'usedId' in app.js is declared but never in use as far as I can tell.
- Good use with variables in scss.
- Love the in-animation and that it just stays there.
- Over all, site looks great! :)

## Backlog

- Rename, restructure css and html.
- Fix in-animation on vercel build deployment (i.e. subsequently .gitignore dist)
- Id on page 3 buttons
- Alt text in svg object
- Split css for readability
