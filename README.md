## Code review
### Erik White

- Clever use of the contact list csv and 'invites.json', didn't think of this.
- Don't forget to add 'dist' folder to .gitignore
- 'usedId' in app.js is declared but never in use as far as I can tell.
- Good use with variables in scss.
- Love the in-animation and that it just stays there.
- Over all, site looks great! :)
